# Methods in JS    

>  **Method** is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. 
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions

##  String in java script
- **Double quotes**  ``"Hello"``
- **Single quotes**  ``'Hello'``
- **Backticks**     `` `Hello ${hi}` ``
 
## JS String methods
-   JavaScript String method `charAt()`
     >The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.
The index of the first character is 0, the second 1, ...
The index of the last character is string length - 1 .
-   JavaScript String method `concat()`
    >The concat() method joins two or more strings.
The concat() method does not change the existing strings.
The concat() method returns a new string..
-   JavaScript String method `replace()`
    >The replace() method searches a string for a value or a regular expression.
The replace() method returns a new string with the value(s) replaced.
The replace() method does not change the original string.
    
-   JavaScript String method `replaceAll()`
     >The replaceAll() method returns a new string with all matches of a pattern replaced by
a replacement.
-   JavaScript String method `split()`
    >The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings. The split() method returns the new
array. The split() method does not change the original string. If (" ") is used as separator, the string
is split between words.

-   JavaScript String method `substring(start,end)`
    >The substring() method extracts characters, between two indices (positions), from a string, and
returns the substring.
The substring() method extracts characters from start to end (exclusive).
The substring() method does not change the original string.
If start is greater than end, arguments are swapped: (4, 1) = (1, 4).
Start or end values less than 0, are treated as 0.
-   JavaScript String method `slice(start, end)`
    >The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object
selected from start to end ( end not included) where start and end represent the index of items
in that array.

-   JavaScript String method `toLowerCase()`
    >The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lowercase letters.
The toLowerCase() method does not change the original string.
-   JavaScript String method `toUpperCase()`
    >The toUpperCase() method converts a string to uppercase letters, using current locale.
The toUpperCase() method does not change the original string.

-   JavaScript String method `trim()`
    >Method trim() removes whitespace from both sides of a string.
The trim() method does not change the original string
-   JavaScript String method `includes()`
    >The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified string.
Otherwise it returns false.
The includes() method is case sensitive.
-   JavaScript String method `toString()`
    >The toString() method returns a string representing the object.
By default toString() takes no parameters.

-   JavaScript String method `indexOf()`
    >The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string.
The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found.
The indexOf() method is case sensitive.

-   JavaScript String method `repeat()`
    >The repeat() method creates a new string by repeating the given string a specified number of
times and returns it.

-   JavaScript String method `at()`
    >The at() method takes an integer value and returns a new String.
This method allows for positive and negative integers. Negative integers count 
back from the last string character.


## JS Number methods
-   The `Math.floor()` function rounds down a number to the next smallest integer.
-   The `Math.round()` function returns the number rounded to the nearest integer.
-   The `ceil()` method rounds a decimal number up to the next largest integer and returns it.
-   The `max()` method finds the maximum value among the specified values and returns it.
-   The `min()` method finds the minimum value among the specified values and returns it.
-   The `pow()` method computes the power of a number by raising the second argument to the power of the first argument.
-   The `sqrt()` method computes the square root of a specified number and returns it
-   The `abs()` method finds the absolute value of the specified number (without any sign) and returns it
-   The `Math.random()` function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
-   The `isNaN()` function checks if a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not.
